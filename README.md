# PICO-8 Game Template

This repository is a simple template based on my PICO-8 studies. The idea is to consolidate utilities and base logic to facilitate bootstrapping a new game (studies, prototypes, and game jams).

The resources here gather and encapsulate references from the [PICO-8 CheatSheet][cheatsheet] and from fan sites, forums, and YouTube channels of the PICO-8 community.
